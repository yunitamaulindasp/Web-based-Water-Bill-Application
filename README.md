# Web-based Water Bill Application
<p>
	One of the problems that often arise in the Regional Water Supply Company (PDAM) is customer complaints about their water bill, they often object to the size of their water bill without knowing the details of the bill.
There are still many customers who are dissatisfied with the services provided by PDAMs due to the lack of transparency between PDAMs and customers in terms of water billing.
<p>
	From the problems that arise, a Web-Based PDAM Water Bill History Application was made.
With this application, it is hoped that it can reduce customer complaints due to lack of transparency in terms of water bills and is also expected to be useful for making it easier to check water bills by customers who are outside the city and can increase customer confidence in the environmental performance of PDAM.
<p>
	This web-based application is built using PHP, HTML5, and MySQL as well as Bootstrap.
